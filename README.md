# LC4-Assembler

**Project Description: My Mini LC4 Assembler**

In this project, I explored the intricacies of file input/output (I/O) in C programming as I developed my mini LC4 Assembler. From lectures, I learned that C treats files as I/O devices, categorizing them into "text" and "binary" types. My task involved reading a text file, specifically a .ASM file intended for PennSim, and generating its binary equivalent in the form of a .OBJ file, akin to those produced by PennSim.

**Key Objectives:**

1. **Mastering File Handling:** I gained proficiency in reading and writing both text and binary files in C, utilizing file I/O mechanisms to manipulate data efficiently.

2. **Understanding LC4 Assembly:** I delved into LC4 assembly language syntax and its machine equivalent, crucial for translating assembly instructions into binary representations.

3. **Harnessing String Manipulation:** I employed string handling techniques to parse and process assembly language instructions, facilitating their conversion into machine code.

4. **Leveraging Multidimensional Arrays:** Utilizing multidimensional arrays, I stored and manipulated data structures representing assembly instructions and their corresponding binary representations.

**Tools and Technologies:**

- **Compiler:** I utilized the clang compiler, providing access to the standard C library, to ensure compatibility and leverage its robust features for efficient code development.

**Project Deliverables:**

1. **My Mini LC4 Assembler Program:** I developed a C program capable of reading assembly language from a .ASM file, translating it into binary code, and generating a .OBJ file as output.

2. **Comprehensive Documentation:** I provided detailed documentation outlining the design, implementation, and usage of my mini LC4 Assembler, including explanations of algorithms and data structures employed.

3. **Thorough Testing:** Creating a suite of test cases, I validated the functionality and accuracy of my assembler, ensuring correct translation of assembly instructions into binary code across various scenarios.

**Project Scope and Limitations:**

- **Compiler:** The project utilized the clang compiler instead of the LCC compiler, enabling access to the standard C library for enhanced functionality.

- **Focus:** My primary focus was on file handling, string manipulation, and multidimensional arrays, with specific emphasis on implementing a functional LC4 assembler rather than advanced optimization techniques.

**Conclusion:**

Through the development of my mini LC4 Assembler, this project offered me an opportunity to deepen my understanding of file I/O, string manipulation, and multidimensional arrays in C programming. By successfully completing this project, I not only enhanced my proficiency in C programming but also gained practical experience in working with assembly language and binary file formats.
